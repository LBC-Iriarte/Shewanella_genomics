Methods

GO term enrichment analysis

– Workflow:

Download genomes —> EggNOG mapper —> run_func.sh —-> fisher3.R —> filter_signi.sh
										          |
										          |
Conservation:   <——————— extract_seq.sh (KatG,hemB, etc)  <— GOATOOLS
   blastp: all-to all of each 
        amino acid protein
        | 
	|
  PROSITE & Pfam

– Code list:

The function of each script is described. The details of how to use each "script" are commented within the code.

$ count_GO_genomes_2.sh
Read and count each GO term on the functional annotation generated by EggNog Mapper v2 on a single genome.

$ run_func.sh
It fulfills a function similar to the script "count_GO_genomes_2.sh" but it does so on a collection of genomes that have been functionally annotated using EggNog. The output is a matrix of presence/absence of the GO and each of the included genomes.

$ fisher3.R
Performs the Fisher test from an MxN matrix with the following columns: “Type Functional Term [for example: GO]”; "number term without zeros"; "cond1_Presence"; “cond2_Presence_Term”; "cond1_Absence_Term"; “cond2_Absense_Term”.

$ filter_signi.sh
Extracts the category or level of the GO terms that were significant from the Fisher test.

$ extract_seq.sh
Extract a sequence or list of amino acid sequences from a fasta file

– Command lines of each program.
## EggNOG Mapper v2. 

The functional annotation of each of the genomes was performed using the following command line:

$ emapper.py -i FASTA_FILE_PROTS -o test --tax_scope bacteria

## GOATOOLS:
We complement the annotation of the results obtained with the script "filter_signi.sh" with one of the tools of the GOATOOLS package.

$ go_plot.py --go_file=tests/data/go_plot/go_selected.txt -r -o selected_go.png

## PROSITE y Pfam:
We use the online servers of each database to perform the blastp.




Phylogenetic analysis

– Workflow:

Download protein sequences —>  get_homologues.pl  —> Clustal Omega v1.2.0
|
|
IQ-Tree v1.6.12 <— concatenador.sh

– Code list:

## Concatenation of alignemnt of orthologous genes.
concatenador.sh takes all the alignments of orthologs made by clustalo software, which were firstly identified by get_homologues.pl. Then the “super” protein was used for phylogenetic analysis, including model prediction and bootstrap analysis, in IQ-tree. concatenador.sh run within the same folder where all alignments (.aln) files are located. Note that the default output of clustalo is an alignment in fasta format with an “.aln” extention.  

$ ./concatenador.sh
